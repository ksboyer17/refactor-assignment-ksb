This project was refactored with HTML and CSS. 

In this project I was task to assess the code for of a businesses website and refactor the code in order to make the code more accessible and cleaner.

By refactoring the code, I was able to reduce the overall amounnt of code by consolidating CSS elements while maintaining the overall funcationality of the code. In addition, I was able to change a large amount of divs to html semantic elements which made the websites code more accessible and cleaner.
