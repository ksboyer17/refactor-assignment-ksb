# Horiseon Refactor

This project was refactored with HTML and CSS. 

In this project I was tasked to assess the code for a businesses that offers SEO Optimization, Online Reputation Asistance and also assistance with Social Media Marketing. The goal was to refactor the code in order to make the code more accessible and cleaner.

By refactoring the code, I was able to reduce the overall amounnt of code by consolidating CSS elements while maintaining the overall funcationality of the code. In addition, I was able to change a large amount of "divs" to html semantic elements which made the websites code more accessible and simpler, which improves the ability for other developers to understand the code. 

In order to access the code in this repository please follow the following steps:
  1. Ensure you are on the main branch
  2. Open the index.html file located in the main root of the repository
  3. Open the Develop folder
  4. Click the Assets folder
  5. Go to the CSS folder
  6. Open the "style.css" folder
   
  
  Overall this project allowed me to practice both my HTML and CSS skills. I was able to accomplish this by familiarizing myself with HTML semantic elements that improve the sites accessibility. Furthermore, I learned how to consolidate CSS elements by altering classes, and in some cases replacing classes all together with simple HTML semantic elements such as a "footer".
